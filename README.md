# Student Marks Prediction

This project uses a simple *Linear Regression model* to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours studied.

# Dataset

A sample dataset with Hours vs Marks is used:

Hours  | Marks
------ | ------
1      | 20
2      | 35
3      | 50
4.5    | 55
5      | 65
5.5    | 68
6.5    | 75
7      | 78
8      | 88
9      | 95
